## What are LoRa and LoRaWAN

LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology that enables long-range communication with low power consumption.
LoRaWAN is a network protocol based on LoRa, widely used for IoT device communication due to its energy efficiency and flexibility.

<br />

## Communication Methods in LoRa

LoRa uses a technology called **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)** to achieve long-range communication with strong interference resistance.
More specifically, CSS is also known as **Spread Spectrum Modulation**, which disperses signals over a wide bandwidth by linearly increasing or decreasing frequency.
This wide dispersion creates characteristic patterns for each signal, making them resistant to interference.
LoRa is also known to be resistant to the Doppler effect of electromagnetic waves.

Furthermore, this mechanism is simple, allowing communication between devices and gateways using the same system.
Specifically, communication from devices to gateways is called **Uplink**, while communication in the opposite direction is called **Downlink**.

<br />

### Spreading Factor (SF)

**Spreading Factor (SF)** is an important parameter in LoRa communication that controls the data transmission rate.
More formally defined, SF represents the number of bits per symbol.
Therefore, the higher the SF, the lower the bit rate, resulting in slower communication speed and higher power consumption due to longer transmission times.
On the other hand, higher SF allows signals to be transmitted over a wider bandwidth, enabling longer-range communication.

| SF   | Communication Speed | Communication Range | Power Consumption |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| High | Slow                | Long                | High              |
| Low  | Fast                | Short               | Low               |

### Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)

Since SF is an important parameter that controls the trade-off between communication efficiency and power consumption, LoRaWAN often uses an algorithm called **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**.
ADR dynamically adjusts the device's SF by considering network conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and communication quality.
This allows devices to select optimal SF values and optimize communication efficiency and power consumption.

### Why LoRa is More Energy Efficient Than Other Communication Methods

In wireless communication, electromagnetic waves propagate through air, causing signal attenuation.
This signal attenuation is called **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)** and is expressed by the following formula:

$$
FSPL(d) = 20 \log_{10}(d) + 20 \log_{10}(f) + K
where d is distance, f is frequency, and K is a constant.
$$

Using FSPL, the energy received at the receiver can be quantitatively evaluated as follows:

$$
Received Energy = Transmitted Energy - FSPL + Transmit/Receive Antenna Gain + Other Losses
$$

In wireless communication, the energy received by the receiver must be greater than the receiver's sensitivity.
Therefore, the difference between the received energy and receiver sensitivity represents the communication margin, called the **Link Budget**.
A larger Link Budget means the communication is more stable.

Generally, receiver sensitivity is determined by the communication method.
Specifically, under the same Link Budget conditions, LoRa has lower receiver sensitivity compared to other communication methods such as Wi-Fi or Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT).
Therefore, LoRa can achieve stable communication with less energy even in long-range communications where signal attenuation is significant.

### Attenuation Due to Obstacles

While LoRa's communication range can theoretically reach up to 850 km, in reality, it is typically 5-10 km due to the effects of attenuation, reflection, scattering from terrain and buildings, and Fresnel zone effects.
Scientific studies have shown that LoRa performance improves under conditions with higher SF values.

Since electromagnetic waves are attenuated by various factors, proper gateway placement is crucial.
For example, the following guidelines exist:
| Condition | Communication Range |
| ---- | -------- |
| Indoor | < 0.5 km |
| Outdoor, house rooftop | 1-2 km |
| Outdoor, tall building rooftop | > 10 km |

### LoRa Limitations

Each region has specific limitations for LoRa communication.

Particularly in Japan, attention must be paid to the following:

- Maximum dwell time (continuous signal transmission time) is 400 ms
- LBT (Listen Before Talk, mechanism to check channel availability before transmission) implementation is required
- No specific limitations on Duty Cycle (channel usage rate)

## Types of LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a protocol for managing communication between devices and gateways, classified into the following three classes:

| Class   | Power Consumption | Latency | Characteristics                                                                                     | Examples                                          |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Class A | Low               | High    | Transmission is initiated only by devices, and the network responds only after device transmission. | Pulse communication of sensors                    |
| Class B | Medium            | Medium  | Transmission is initiated by devices or by the network at regular intervals.                        | Periodic communication like beacons               |
| Class C | High              | Low     | Transmission is initiated by the network, and devices constantly listen for transmissions.          | Real-time communication like street light control |

In LoRaWAN, transmission payload size is limited to about 51-222 bytes, and data rates are limited to, for example, a maximum of 5.5 kbps with 125kHz bandwidth.
Therefore, data compression and efficient packet design are important during communication.
However, these limitations vary by region, so it's necessary to comply with the regulations of the region being used.
Also, note that communication is asynchronous, as Uplink generally has larger communication capacity than Downlink.

## LoRaWAN Security

Since LoRa does not provide security at the physical layer, it's necessary to use LoRaWAN to ensure security.

### LoRaWAN Sessions

LoRaWAN provides security mechanisms from the following three perspectives:

| Perspective         | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Authenticity**    | Authentication for the network to identify devices and authorize communication |
| **Integrity**       | Mechanism to prevent tampering in intermediate paths                           |
| **Confidentiality** | Data is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping within the network                  |

Specifically, each session provides security at both network and application layers as follows:

| Layer             | Assured Aspects           | Key Components                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network Layer     | Authentication, Integrity | DevAddr (Device Address), NwkSKey (Network Session Key)<br/>FCntUp, FCntDown (Frame Counters)<br/>Mac State (channels, data rate, etc...) |
| Application Layer | Confidentiality           | AppSKey (Application Session Key)<br/>FCntUp, FCntDown                                                                                    |

LoRaWAN uses AES encryption, with different keys for network and application layers.
Therefore, session keys remain fixed during each session.
Frame counters are incremented with each transmission and reception.

Also, note that since there's no security at the physical layer, the following metadata is always publicly available:

| Metadata Name   | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| JoinEUI(AppEUI) | Pointer to Join server           |
| DevEUI          | Device identifier                |
| DevAddr         | Device address                   |
| FCntUp,FCntDown | Frame counters                   |
| Port Number     | Application layer port number    |
| Payload Length  | Length of payload                |
| MAC Commands    | Type and content of MAC commands |

### Session Protocols

The following two protocols are common in LoRaWAN:

| Protocol Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                              | Characteristics                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation)**      | Devices perform network joining procedures at session start<br/>Session keys are generated from root keys during joining, and the network issues DevAddr | Re-keying possible<br/>Devices can join any network<br/>High security                                        |
| **ABP (Activation By Personalization)** | Devices use pre-configured DevAddr and session keys to join the network<br/>Network must be pre-configured, and session keys are fixed                   | Devices can only join specific networks<br/>Lower security due to fixed session keys<br/>Can save disk space |

Unless there are specific restrictions, using OTAA is recommended.

Root keys used in session key generation are generally provisioned from trusted Join Servers during device manufacturing.
Therefore, it's important to **not share root keys with third parties or reuse them**.

### Session Keys by Version

LoRaWAN currently has two versions: 1.0 series and 1.1 series.
Each version generates different session keys as follows:

| Version | Root Key | Session Keys                         |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | AppKey   | AppSKey, NwkSKey                     |
| 1.1.x   | AppKey   | AppSKey                              |
|         | NwkKey   | FNwkSIntKey, SNwkSIntKey, NwkSEncKey |

In the 1.1 series, network session keys are split into three: FNwkSIntKey (Forwarding Network Session Integrity Key) and SNwkSIntKey (Serving Network Session Integrity Key) are used for security checks, while NwkSEncKey (Network Session Encryption Key) is used for encryption.

The 1.1 series is more secure, but unfortunately, as of May 2025, it's not widely adopted yet.

### Other Features

LoRaWAN also provides other security features such as:

- MAC commands for checking communication quality and availability
- Mechanisms to confirm message delivery
- Frame counters to prevent replay attacks (attacks that retransmit already received messages)
- DevNounce to uniquely identify each join attempt

<br />

## Best Practices in LoRaWAN

To improve performance in LoRaWAN communication, the following best practices exist:

- Implement each device correctly according to LoRaWAN specifications.
- Use OTAA whenever possible.
- Avoid unnecessary join requests.
- Set appropriate device transmission frequencies.
- Keep transmission payloads as small as possible.
- Be aware that packet loss is unavoidable.
- Don't synchronize transmission timing of each device. Especially avoid transmitting at fixed times like 00:00.
- When devices are stationary, use ADR to automatically adjust device SF.
- Use device persistent memory to save states like session keys, frame counters, and DevNounce.
- Assume communication loss only after about three or more acknowledgment losses. Don't assume device malfunction after a single response failure.

<br />

## Summary and Thoughts

LoRa is a wireless communication technology that achieves long-range communication using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS), characterized by low energy consumption and high fault tolerance.
However, since security is not provided at the physical layer, it's necessary to use the LoRaWAN protocol to ensure security.
Specifically, session management through the network joining process with OTAA is common, providing security from the perspectives of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.
In LoRaWAN, it's important to implement with small data packets for long-range communication in mind, and attention must be paid to regional restrictions on Dwell Time and Duty Cycle.

Through learning LoRaWAN, I believe I've gained the minimum knowledge of LoRaWAN communication.
In the future, I want to pursue more in-depth learning about individual sensor and gateway implementations and actually build IoT systems using LoRaWAN.
