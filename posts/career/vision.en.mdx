## Introduction

According to ChatGPT, you can craft a career vision with the following steps:

> 1. **Self-analysis** - Understand your strengths, weaknesses, and interests.
> 2. **Build a long-term vision** - Picture where you want to be in five or ten years.
> 3. **Set milestones** - Identify the skills and experiences you need and turn them into concrete action plans.
> 4. **Feedback & adjustment** - Review your vision regularly and refine it as needed.

Following this process, I have articulated my own vision.
The detailed results of my self-analysis are listed on the [About](/about) page.

## Setting the Milestones

I structured the milestones in this sequence:

1. Conduct [scenario planning](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/scenario-planning) to analyze future uncertainties.
2. Create core strategies and scenario-specific options for each possible future.
3. Translate the core strategies into concrete milestones.

### Scenario Planning

Among the external driving forces, I selected two axes:

- **Demographic change (depopulation & aging)**: severe vs moderate
- **Tech progress (AI/analytics & smart farming)**: stagnation vs advancement

This yields four scenarios:

1. **High depopulation / Tech stagnation** - Severe depopulation, little tech adoption; pursue low-tech, self-reliant communities.
2. **High depopulation / Tech advancement** - Few residents but advanced tech; remote healthcare & automated farms thrive, but digital divide widens.
3. **Low depopulation / Tech stagnation** - Some population inflow, low tech; face-to-face mutual aid grows, productivity gains are limited.
4. **Low depopulation / Tech advancement** - Multi-generation community with advanced tech; smart village forms, but maintenance costs & digital gaps remain concerns.

## Conclusion

By articulating this vision, I now have a clear direction for my career and lifestyle.
I will use planners and calendars to stay conscious of these goals and push my tasks forward daily.

## Final Thoughts

I drafted this vision with help from OpenAI O3.
With its stronger agent-like capabilities—researching information automatically while answering—it feels more practical than ever.

I’m excited to see how such agentic AI progresses throughout 2025.
