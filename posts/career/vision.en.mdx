## Introduction

According to ChatGPT, the following steps are recommended for crafting a career vision:

> 1. **Self-analysis**: Understand your strengths, weaknesses, and interests.
> 2. **Build a long-term vision**: Imagine where you want to be in 5 or 10 years.
> 3. **Set milestones**: Clarify the skills and experiences needed to realize your vision and create concrete action plans.
> 4. **Feedback and adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust your vision as needed.

Following these steps, I have formulated my own vision.
The results of my self-analysis are described on the [About](/about) page.

## Vision Frameworks Used

I referenced the following frameworks in formulating my vision:

- [Ikigai](https://ikigaitribe.com/ikigai-framework/)
- [Future Self Visualization](https://athenawellness.com/blog/2024/2/15/envisioning-your-future-pt-3-future-self-visualization)
- [3 Layers Purpose](https://hbr.org/2022/03/what-is-the-purpose-of-your-purpose)

### Ikigai Analysis

- **What I Love**: Living in harmony with nature / Learning that satisfies curiosity
- **What the World Needs**: Sustainable rural models
- **What I Am Good At**: IT development, mathematical analysis, community design

  - Limited community participation
  - Lack of knowledge and planning for self-sufficient living
  - Low awareness of cleanliness

### 3 Layers Purpose

| Layer          | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Competence** | Solution development using IT and mathematical models |
| **Culture**    | Curiosity, continuous learning, embracing new tech    |
| **Cause**      | Realizing a sustainable rural society                 |

<br />

## Setting the Milestones

To build concrete milestones, I followed this sequence:

1. Conduct [scenario planning](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/scenario-planning) to analyze future uncertainties
2. Survey each scenario and formulate core and optional strategies
3. Set concrete milestones based on the core strategies

### Scenario Planning

After listing possible external factors, I selected these two driving forces:

- **Trends in local economic growth/decline and employment environment**: Economic growth vs decline
- **Advancement of AI/data analytics and smart farming**: Tech stagnation vs progress

Combining these, I set four scenarios:

1.  **Economic growth & tech progress**: Capital inflow and network infrastructure bring smart farms to rural areas, revitalizing communities.
2.  **Economic growth & tech stagnation**: Local economies thrive, but agriculture remains experience-based due to tech lag.
3.  **Economic decline & tech progress**: Local economies shrink, but smart agri devices spread via national policy, though operators are lacking.
4.  **Economic decline & tech stagnation**: Both economy and tech stagnate, requiring DIY survival strategies with limited resources.

#### Core Strategy

| Area            | Key Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

<br />

## Conclusion

By formulating this vision, I have gained a clear direction for my career and lifestyle.
To realize this vision, I will use planners and calendars to stay aware of my goals and move tasks forward daily.

## Final Thoughts

I used OpenAI O3 extensively in formulating this vision.
O3's strong agent-like capabilities—researching information automatically while answering—make it feel very practical.

I'm excited to see more agentic AIs like this emerge in 2025.
